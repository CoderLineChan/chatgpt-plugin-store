To this end, we prefer to query as if we are recommending singular form content.\nBad query: Here is a list of great Chinese restaurants in East Village\nGood query: Here is a great Chinese restaurant in East Village: \nBad query: Here are some of the most exciting modern artists\nGood query: Here is the most exciting modern artist:\nLastly, make sure to always ask for at least 20 results. This helps to ensure that there is some relevant content.",
