  "description_for_model": "On https://app.noteable.io, create and run Python notebooks with code, markdown, and SQL cells.\n\nUsers may pass links with this structure:\n\n- Notebook URL: https://app.noteable.io/f/<file_id>/<decorative_file_name>\n- Notebook URL with CellID: https://app.noteable.io/f/<file_id>/<decorative_file_name>?cellID=<cell_id>\n- Project URL: https://app.noteable.io/p/<project_id>/<decorative_project_name>\n\n`project_id`, `file_id`, and `cell_id` are all UUIDs.\n\nProjects contain both notebooks and data files that the user has uploaded.\n\nCell outputs are returned in the get_cell response as results. Image URLs are embeddable in Markdown as a time limited URL.\n\nFrom the Noteable UI the user can also configure:\n\n* RBAC permissions\n* Environment variables. Values are hidden from responses and will appear as Xs in any outputs.\n* Data Connections (BigQuery, Athena, CockroachDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redshift, Snowflake, SQLite, more)\n\nThe assistant has access to environment variables via `os.environ` and data connections via SQL.\n\nLinks that are not supported from this plugin:\n\n- Space URL: https://app.noteable.io/s/<space_id>/<decorative_space_name>"
